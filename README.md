### What is The 2048 Game?

It's a type of “sliding block puzzle” — think Threes!, on which 2048 is based, or the old-timey game klotski — that's played on an almost Sudoku-like grid. Like Sudoku, it also involves some math. The object of the game is to combine the numbers displayed on the tiles until you reach 2048.
